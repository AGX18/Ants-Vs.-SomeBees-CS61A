# Ants Vs. SomeBees
## What is it:
a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. 
As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster.
Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that 
invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, 
and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, 
and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by 
PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

## How to play:
The Game
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. 
Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. 
Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. 
Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food or throwing leaves at the bees. 
The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of the tunnel (you lose), the bees destroy a QueenAnt if it exists (you lose), 
or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (you win).
